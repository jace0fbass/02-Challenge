# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Screen Shot

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually you'll learn how to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

## Description 

In this challenge I have refactored the Index.html, Style.css, and the README.md. I changed elements to more appropriate ones as well as changed the h2 for the footer to h4 so it would be sequential. I have restored proper function to the "Search Engine Optimization" tab. I consolidated font families, deleted empty rules, consolidated benefit and content items, consolidated a and p
to be with * and body. I have edited the read me to include a description and left previous information that I felt like would be important for the future.
